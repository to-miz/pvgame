todo:
	implement deleteMesh so that meshes created with uploadMeshToGpu can be destroyed
		DynamicVoxelCollection needs to delete created meshes
	rework framerate independent movement, seems to have some problems
	rethink 2d and 3d coordinate systems, there are a lot of inlined conversions between the two coordinate systems

bugs:

gameplay:
	hit detection
	screen shake
	health, dying and restarting
	hud display
	enemies
	finalize room storage
	tile layers and background sprites with scrolling
	room transitions
	bosses
	upgrades
		hovering
		double jump
		walljump?
		sliding
	weapon drops

	room generation?
	multiplayer
